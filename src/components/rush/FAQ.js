            Fraternities and Sororities are what many people refer to "Greek Life"â€” societies that induct members for lifetime membership. Sororities are all-female Greek Organizations, while Fraternities can be both all-male and co-ed Organizations. Each organization has certain rules and values that make each one unique; however, they are often considered either "Social" or "Professional" groups. Professional Greek Organizations have strong focus on developing their members professionally as well as creating a strong Brotherhood or Sisterhood.

          <Accordion.Body className = 'faq-question-ans'>
            Theta Tau is a Co-ed Professional Engineering Fraternity. This makes us a professional fraternity, which means we value the professional development and conduct of our members more than a social fraternity might. We are also composed of members that have an interest in Engineering, which unites us as another common focus. Finally, we are co-ed, and accept members of all genders.

          <Accordion.Body className = 'faq-question-ans'>
          Rushing is an interesting term to describe the first interactions you have with Greek organization. Theta Tau's Rush week is designed to introduce you to the Fraternity and it's members. You don't have to be an Engineer to attend Theta Tau rush events, and you are allowed to Rush other Greek fraternities and sororities while rushing Theta Tau.
