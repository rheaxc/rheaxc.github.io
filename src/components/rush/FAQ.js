            Fraternities and Sororities are what many people refer to "Greek Life"â€” societies that induct members for lifetime membership. Sororities are all-female Greek Organizations, while Fraternities can be both all-male and co-ed Organizations. Each organization has certain rules and values that make each one unique; however, they are often considered either "Social" or "Professional" groups. Professional Greek Organizations have strong focus on developing their members professionally as well as creating a strong Brotherhood or Sisterhood.

          <Accordion.Body className = 'faq-question-ans'>
            Theta Tau is a Co-ed Professional Engineering Fraternity. This makes us a professional fraternity, which means we value the professional development and conduct of our members more than a social fraternity might. We are also composed of members that have an interest in Engineering, which unites us as another common focus. Finally, we are co-ed, and accept members of all genders.
